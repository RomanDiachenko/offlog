Local-first task manager for browser, Android, and Windows. This file is a
reference: what it's built with, how it's laid out, and the few ideas that
aren't obvious from the code.

## Stack

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| UI | **Svelte 5** + TypeScript | No virtual DOM, small bundle |
| Build | **Vite 8** | |
| Local database | **PouchDB 9** | IndexedDB in the browser; speaks the CouchDB replication protocol |
| Sync server | Any **CouchDB-protocol** server (CouchDB, or **NyxDB**) | Self-hosted, optional. The app is fully usable without one |
| Android | **Capacitor 8** | Wraps the same `dist/` in a WebView |
| Windows | **Tauri 2** (`offlog-desktop/`) | Wraps the same `dist/`, embeds a NyxDB sync host |
| Notifications | `@capacitor/local-notifications` / Web Notification API / `tauri-winrt-notification` (Windows) | |
| Biometrics | `capacitor-native-biometric` | Android only, opt-in alongside the PIN |
| Privacy screen | `@capacitor/privacy-screen` | Opt-in; also blocks screenshots |
| Clipboard / Haptics / Launcher | `@capacitor/clipboard`, `-haptics`, `-app-launcher` | |
| Styling | CSS custom properties | No CSS framework |
| Fonts | Hanken Grotesk only | `--mono` points at the same face |
| Notes editor | **CodeMirror 6** (`@codemirror/*`, `@lezer/markdown`) | Live markdown rendering in one pane — see `shared/MarkdownEditor.svelte` |

**Two TypeScripts, on purpose.** `@typescript/native` is an alias for
TypeScript 7 (the native compiler) and does the real checking, via
`svelte-check --tsgo`. Plain `typescript` is 6.x because svelte-check's
peer range is `^5 || ^6` and it loads the classic TS API. Both packages
ship a `tsc` binary, so `npm run check` calls TypeScript 7 by explicit
path rather than through `node_modules/.bin/tsc` — which shim npm writes
there depends on hoist order, and the gate must not change compiler
silently.

## Architecture

Four layers, one direction. The UI never touches the database directly for
state; it reads stores and calls `db.ts`.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    UI["UI<br/>App.svelte + views"] --> Store["store.ts<br/>Svelte stores"]
    Store --> DB["db.ts<br/>PouchDB"]
    DB -.->|replication| Sync["Sync server<br/>optional"]
```

- **UI** — `App.svelte` routes between Dashboard, Focus, Agenda, Board
  (`KanbanBoard.svelte`), List, plus modals (CardDetail, QuickAdd, GlobalSearch, Settings). On a
  phone-sized screen (`PHONE_QUERY` in `phone/nav.ts`, the same breakpoint as
  the desktop layout's mobile rules) `<main>` renders `phone/PhoneApp.svelte`
  instead: four tabs (Home, Today, Agenda, Search), each a stack of screens.
  Held sideways (`(orientation: landscape) and (max-height: 500px)`) the tabs
  become a rail on the left, pages keep a 680px column, sheets a 600px
  width, and Home, the lock screen and Welcome switch to
  shorter or two-column layouts so their main action is on the first screen.
  Each shell is its own chunk, imported dynamically only on its side:
  `phone/PhoneApp.svelte` on a phone, `desktopViews.ts` (Sidebar, the five
  views, FilterBar, QuickAdd, GlobalSearch, CardDetail) everywhere else, so
  neither downloads the other. App.svelte awaits the desktop chunk before
  `ready`, so the Tauri window never reveals a half-built UI; App.svelte must
  only ever reference those components through it (a static import pulls them
  back into the main bundle).
  On the phone, the note editor (CodeMirror, about half a megabyte) is a
  third chunk: `phone/noteEditor.ts` fetches it 1.5 s after PhoneApp mounts
  and TaskScreen awaits it, so it stays off start-up. Nothing on the phone
  path may import `MarkdownEditor.svelte` statically. `public/pouchdb.js` is
  PouchDB's own minified `dist/pouchdb.min.js`; on an upgrade, copy that
  file, not the unminified one.
  Every pushed screen owns one `modalStack` history entry, so Android back
  pops screens and overlays in one LIFO order; back at a non-Home tab root
  goes Home, and back at Home's root sends the app to the background
  (`CapApp.minimizeApp()`, never `exitApp()`, which would make the next open
  a cold start). With nothing open on Home, App.svelte hands Back to the
  system (`toggleBackButtonHandler`, driven by `modalStack`'s `openLayers`;
  Android 13+ only, and never while App Lock is up) so Android plays its
  predictive-back preview; the manifest sets
  `enableOnBackInvokedCallback`. The plugin flips that switch off the UI
  thread, which leaves Android's own callback on top: `scripts/patch-capacitor-app.js`
  (postinstall) wraps it in `runOnUiThread` until upstream does. The back
  handler also trusts `openLayers` over `canGoBack`: Chrome hides history
  entries pushed without a gesture (a sheet opened from the widget) from it. Re-tapping the current tab at its root scrolls it to the
  top; the + steps aside on a long downward scroll (`fabScroll.ts`). Overdue
  has "Move all to today" (with Undo), which leaves repeating tasks alone (their due date is
  what the next repeat counts from).
  Week start and 12/24h follow the device locale (`Intl`) until chosen in
  Appearance. Screens: Home, Today/Overdue/Pinned, Search,
  Project (board by status with a drag-following swipe, list with select +
  bulk bar — a held row enters Select — filter and menu sheets; the card
  menu's status pills move a task in one tap) and Statuses, Task (full screen, every field saved as it
  changes, pickers in bottom sheets; order is title, note, status bar, fields,
  steps (the circle ticks, the text edits in place, a hold drags to reorder,
  Alt+arrows from a keyboard) — the rows show values, not labels, Due/Priority/Tags always, the
  other fields only once set, the unset ones behind one "Add …" row; dates
  read "Sun 4 Oct" via `phone/format.ts` `shortDate()`; every phone date
  is picked on `phone/Month.svelte`, every time on the wheels), Agenda (month, or a list from tomorrow on, with one row back to Today), Focus, Settings
  (pushed pages that reuse `shared/AppearanceSettings.svelte`, plus Recycle bin, History, Archived
  projects, and Organize — spaces, tags and fields in `phone/settings/organize/`
  instead of the desktop manager overlays). Quick add is a bottom sheet that adds where the user is (the
  project and status on show via `nav.addContext`, or Agenda's chosen day).
  `nav.actions` routes task opening, quick add and Settings into the shell;
  `nav.showToast` is the Undo snackbar for reversible actions. An Undo arriving while another is still up merges into it ("2 tasks done", mixed kinds "2 changes"), and Undo reverts all of them, newest first, so a quick second change never costs the first its Undo. A write with no Undo of its own (a field edit, a step tick, committing Focus picks) calls `nav.sealUndo()`, which also retires a live Undo, so no Undo can reach past that write and silently revert it. Bottom sheets
  are `phone/Sheet.svelte` (a `closeOnBack` consumer: mount behind `{#key}`),
  at z-index 650. Confirms on the phone are `phone/ConfirmSheet.svelte` (a
  `raised` sheet at 700, mounted in PhoneApp); `ConfirmDialog` is desktop-only. Shared phone
  styles are `phone/phone.css`, all scoped under `.phone-shell`/`.psheet`.
  Only the top screen is mounted; a screen keeps state it wants back (board
  status, filters, sort, search query, Agenda month) on its stack entry via
  `nav.memo()`. Board/List is a per-device choice in localStorage
  (`offlog_phone_view_<projectId>`, first open follows `default_view`); the
  phone never writes the synced `default_view`. Reversible actions (finish,
  move, archive, delete, Focus reset) act at once with Undo; confirms are kept
  for deleting a project, deleting for good, emptying the bin and clearing
  history. Widget and notification jumps use `nav.navigate()`, which waits
  for `closeAll()`'s history jump before pushing. Cross-project rows
  (`phone/TaskCard.svelte`: Today, Overdue, Pinned, Agenda, Search) finish
  through the project list's `toggleDone`, so haptic, snackbar and Undo
  match; holding one opens the board's `CardMenuSheet` through
  `phone/TaskMenu.svelte`. Nothing on a card shows the hold, so the first plain tap on a card with a menu shows a one-time tip (`phone/holdTip.ts`, a localStorage flag also set by any hold; it waits while an Undo is showing). A row drops its date when its section
  already names that day. The phone shell never runs in the Tauri window.
  Widget deep links (`com.offlog.app://focus|quickadd|dashboard|agenda|project`)
  arrive through `@capacitor/app` (`getLaunchUrl()` cold, `appUrlOpen` warm)
  and route to `nav.navigate()`; a quick add is queued until the shell has
  mounted. Focus holds three picks in the day's `focusLock.ts` commitment,
  ranked by `shared/focusRank.ts`, the same scoring the desktop's FocusView
  uses. Home applies `livingHero.ts`'s hue/lightness shift on mount and on
  every return to the foreground. `searchAllTasks()` (shared with the desktop's
  GlobalSearch) returns open before done, title matches first, then by due
  date (undated last), then title; archived tasks of active projects come
  last (marked, with Restore from archive on the task), those of archived
  projects not at all. A query starting with `#` searches tags only.
- **store.ts** — the only reactive layer for app data. Holds spaces, projects,
  tasks and the active selection; reloads on any database change.
- **db.ts** — all reads and writes, the changelog, the undo buffer, and
  sync control.
- **Sync server** — optional. All devices replicate through one database
  named `offlog`.

## Source File Map

Paths are relative to `offlog-app/`. Every source file is listed except the phone shell's
per-screen sheets and pages, which are grouped by folder. The engine (database, stores,
formatting, theme, notifications) sits at the root of `lib/`; `desktop/` and `phone/` are the
two shells and `shared/` the screen pieces both use. `tests/layout.test.ts` fails if
anything in `phone/` or `shared/` imports from `desktop/`.

```

      focusRank.ts                Focus suggestions: scoring and the round-robin spread (both Focus screens)

```

**Two CSS rules worth knowing:**

- `CardDetail.svelte` and `SettingsPanel.svelte` own their children's
  **class** rules as `:global()` under a parent wrapper, because the markup
  now lives in child components and scoping would drop it.
- Bare **element** rules (`button`, `label`, `textarea`) must stay scoped
  and be copied into each child. A `:global(button)` also matches nested
  components' internal buttons (CustomSelect, CalendarPicker) and restyles
  them.

## Data Model

One PouchDB database, `offlog`. The `_id` prefix is the document type.

| Prefix | Type | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `space:` | SpaceDoc | `name`, `color`, `icon`, `position` |
| `project:` | ProjectDoc | `space_id`, `name`, `columns[]`, `default_view`, `archived`, `saved_filters[]` (List/Board filters by name; `shared/savedFilters.ts` moves a device's old `offlog_saved_filters_<id>` localStorage copy in once) |
| `task:` | TaskDoc | `project_id`, `column_id`, `title`, `body`, `priority`, `due_date`, `tags`, `deleted`, `archived` |
| `log:` | LogDoc | `ts`, `source`, `source_id`, `ref`, `action`, then `field`/`from`/`to` or `diffs` |
| `meta:` | Custom field definitions (`meta:custom_fields`); the sync host's Offlog name (`meta:sync-host`, written by the Windows app that hosts sync, only on change, no History entry, so phones show the PC by that name) | `fields[]`; `device_id`, `name` |
| `tag:` | Tag colour override | `tag`, `color` |

### Rules

- **Done is positional.** A task is complete when its `column_id` is the
  project's **last** column. There is no `done` boolean, so a task can never
  disagree with the column it sits in.
- **Soft delete.** Deleting a task sets `deleted: true`; it sits in the
  Recycle bin and keeps its history. A real removal replicates as a
  tombstone, so only the paths CLAUDE.md lists remove a task: Delete forever,
  Empty, and retention, which clears tasks binned more than 3 months ago
  (`TASK_RETENTION_MONTHS` in `db/maintenance.ts`).
- **Archive.** `archived: true` hides a task from normal views; restorable.
  Archiving a *project* cascades onto its open tasks and marks each
  `archivedWithProject: true`, so un-archiving restores exactly those and
  leaves any the user archived individually alone. Tasks hidden by a cascade
  from before the flag existed cannot be identified and stay archived.
- **Ordering** uses fractional positions, so inserting between two tasks
  never renumbers the rest.
- **History is best-effort, excerpted and kept 6 months**
  (`LOG_RETENTION_MONTHS`; the prune runs at most weekly from the hourly
  housekeeping). Every mutation attempts a `log:`
  doc via `logChange()`, which never rejects: a failed log write is a
  `console.warn` (error name only), and the action still resolves, because
  its data write has already landed. Strings longer than 120 characters in
  `from`/`to`/`diffs` (task notes, long custom-field values, checklist
  items) are stored as their first 120 characters plus `…`, never as full
  copies; a diff shortened that way carries `changed: true`, and readers
  must use `isRealDiff()` from `logFormat.ts` rather than compare the
  excerpts. Older entries may still hold full bodies; every view renders a
  notes change as "Notes updated" and never shows its text.
- **Priority** is `1` low, `2` medium, `3` high. The desktop shows it as a
  left border; the phone tints the finish ring for medium and high only, with
  a screen-reader label.
- **Pinned** always sorts to the top.
- **"Status" vs "Column".** Users see "Status". The stored field is
  `column_id` — a frozen legacy name.
- **Source** is the device name that made a write, for the changelog. Until someone picks a name it is the
  device's own (Android's device name, else its model, via `@capacitor/device`;
  Windows' computer name, via the desktop's `get_device_name` command), set
  once by `initDeviceName()` before sync starts. Every write reads it fresh
  through `currentSource()`, so that name and any later rename apply from the
  next write; a value cached at import would stamp the generic default.

### Fields with behaviour attached

- **Recurrence** (`daily`/`weekly`/`monthly`, optional interval,
  weekdays-only): one task per series, not a new card per completion.
  Moving it to the last column writes it back to the first with the due
  date advanced from the *original* date, so finishing late doesn't shift
  the schedule. Undo has to restore due date, reminder and checklist too,
  not just the column.
- **Attachments**: bytes live in PouchDB's own `_attachments` on the task,
  so they replicate with it. `TaskAttachment` holds only metadata (`key`,
  filename, type, size, date) — `key` is not the filename, since two files
  can share one. 10 MB per file, 10 per task. Photos are downscaled to
  ~1600px and re-encoded to JPEG before saving; a PNG stays PNG (transparency,
  sharp text), downscaled only when larger and otherwise kept byte for byte.

  Opening one is platform work, not a download: a blob URL on an
  `<a download>` only functions in a browser, so Android writes to cache and
  offers the share sheet and desktop opens a save dialog — the same gap
  `downloadBlob()` documents for exports, but binary rather than UTF-8.
  Both go through `shareViaCache()` (`shared/shareFile.ts`): one
  `cache/share/` folder, emptied before each share, so at most the latest
  shared file (a backup or CSV is the whole task list in plain text) stays
  behind. Deleting it right after the share resolves would break a receiving
  app that reads it later.
  The filename is treated as data on the way to disk: it rides on the doc, so
  it can arrive over sync or from a hand-edited backup, and `safeFileName()`
  strips directory components and leading dots before either platform writes
  it.
- **Related** (`related[]`): non-directional "see also". Stored only on the
  task the link was added from; the reverse direction is computed at read
  time, because PouchDB cannot write two documents atomically.
- **Blocked by** (`blocked_by[]`): a real directional dependency. Whether a
  blocker is done is computed with the positional rule, so it cannot drift.

## Performance & Reliability

**Indexing.** One Mango index, `['type', 'ref']`, serves `getLogsForTask()`
(History): log docs aren't cached and a scan grows with the whole changelog
(5 ms vs 5.4 s at 100,000 logs, real IndexedDB). `getTasksForProject()`, the
hottest read, filters the task cache instead of querying an index. A Mango
index catches up on every edit at its next query (150–350 ms after 200 edits
at 20,000 tasks) and builds from scratch on first use (116 s at 20,000);
the cache read costs under 1 ms. `_design/idx-type-project`, which older
versions created, stays in place: design docs replicate, so deleting it
would ping-pong with devices still on an older version, and an unqueried
index is never rebuilt. Note `db.find()` silently defaults to 25 results —
always pass an explicit `limit`.

**Task cache.** Cross-cutting reads (search, dashboard, agenda, tag
autocomplete) each need *every* task, which no index can narrow.
`getAllTasksRaw()` caches that full scan in memory. Invalidation happens
centrally in `subscribe()` and again inside every task-writing function, so
a read can't beat the change listener. Each invalidation bumps a generation number; a reload or
catch-up only marks the cache current if none landed while it was reading.

**Change feed.** `subscribe()` shares one live PouchDB feed across every
subscriber (opened with the first, closed with the last). The cache is
invalidated on each change, but subscribers are called once per 50ms quiet
period, so a sync burst of hundreds of docs costs each screen one reload.
If the feed dies it restarts after 2s and notifies everyone, since changes
during the gap were never delivered.

**Crash recovery.** `App.svelte` wraps startup in try/catch and shows a
retry screen rather than hanging. `main.ts` listens for `unhandledrejection`
and `error` as a last resort. Every task-mutating call site is wrapped in
try/catch with `showError()` — an audited invariant.

**Integrity check.** `checkIntegrity()` reports nine issue types: orphaned
projects and tasks, tasks pointing at a status that no longer exists,
projects with no statuses, unresolved sync conflicts, values left behind by
a deleted custom field (`removeCustomFieldDef()` sweeps them itself, so
this catches only ones synced in from a device running an older build), `related`/`blocked_by` ids pointing at tasks that
were hard-pruned, active tasks inside an archived project, and
`attachments[]` metadata that disagrees with PouchDB's own `_attachments`.

`repairDatabase()` fixes all but two, which are left for a person:
the no-statuses case, and **conflicts**. Conflicts are never auto-resolved --
keeping whichever revision PouchDB calls the winner is arbitrary, not "most
recent", so auto-repair would silently discard one device's edit.
`scanConflicts()` already auto-settles the two safe cases (a pristine default
against a real edit, and a phantom left by NyxDB before v0.1.7, below), so
anything still standing is a genuine disagreement;
Settings -> Sync -> Resolve conflicts is where it gets decided. It accepts the issue list a caller already computed —
`runMaintenanceSteps()` passes its own, so a run scans once rather than
two or three times. Repair rewrites documents and drops conflicting
revisions with no undo, so it asks first: `MaintOptions.confirmRepair` is a
callback (db/ must never import UI) that SettingsPanel fulfils with
`confirmAction()` and the phone's `PrefsPage` with its own confirm. Declining leaves the data untouched and reports the
issues as needing review.

It reads every doc except the changelog, in two `allDocs` range scans either
side of `log:` (`conflictBearingRows()` in `db/sync.ts`), so the changelog is
not loaded — and `checked` counts only records a check actually inspected.
Not a per-prefix allowlist: the same rows feed the conflict pass, and an
allowlist there stops reporting conflicts on docs outside it (such as
`meta:custom_fields`) that the sync badge still counts. `log:` docs are excluded from the
conflict pass on purpose: their ids embed a random suffix, so two devices
can never mint the same one.

**Maintenance run.** `runMaintenanceSteps()` sequences check → repair →
prune history → prune trash → compact, reporting each through `onStep`.
`MaintOptions.isCancelled` is polled between steps; a step already in
flight always finishes, since neither a `bulkDocs` nor a compaction can be
interrupted safely.

Compaction is the expensive step: PouchDB's `_compact` walks the changes
feed from seq 0 and fires one `compactDocument()` per row concurrently, so
on a churned database it queues thousands of IndexedDB transactions and
starves the main thread for minutes. It is also usually pointless — the
database is opened with `auto_compaction`, so revision bodies are discarded
as each write lands. So it runs exactly once and never again -- not
"whenever this run deleted something": a repair only rewrites docs and a
prune only tombstones them, and in both cases the old bodies are already
gone, so that rule would pay the full walk for zero bytes. Databases
predating `auto_compaction` get the one real pass, marked done in
`offlog_compacted`.

Every purge (Empty Recycle bin, delete forever, retention pruning, deleting a
project, clearing history, a data reset) writes a bare
`{_id, _rev, _deleted: true}` tombstone (`tombstone()` in `entities.ts`). A
deleted revision that kept the doc's fields would keep its `_attachments`
digests, so the blobs were never freed, and it replicated the deleted
content to every paired device.

**Automatic backup** (`autoBackup.ts`). Runs at most every ~20h, writing the
same JSON as a manual export to app-private storage (desktop
`appDataDir()/auto-backups/`, Android `Directory.Data`; no-op on web). Keeps
the newest 7. Plain unencrypted JSON, on-device, never uploaded. Failures
are logged and retried next run — the timestamp only advances on success.
A stored timestamp in the future (the clock was once set ahead) counts as
due, as do the retention stamps; otherwise all three stall until real time
catches up.
Backup settings list the kept copies (`listAutoBackups()`, newest first) and
open one in the same preview and restore as a picked file. `readAutoBackup()`
takes only a name matching the copies' own pattern, never a path; the
Windows app may read text files only inside `$APPDATA/auto-backups`
(`fs:allow-read-text-file` in its capabilities). A debug build keeps its copies in `auto-backups-dev`:
it shares the installed app's app-data folder, and the newest-7 rotation
would otherwise push out the user's real copies.

**Restore** (`importJSON()`) updates docs in place. A one-project export
inlines attachments like the full backup; for an older file that carries
only `{stub: true}` entries, a stub whose key the live doc still holds keeps
that attachment rather than deleting it. `meta:custom_fields` is merged by
field id (the backup's definition wins on the same id), never replaced: a
field created after the backup keeps its definition, so Repair doesn't
erase its values.

Each file is a full snapshot with attachments inlined as base64, so the
folder grows with attachment size, not task count: 5.7 MB of attachments
measured at 6.2 MB per file and 43 MB across the seven kept. That storage
sits outside IndexedDB, so `navigator.storage.estimate()` — what Settings'
storage headline reads — does not count it. `getAutoBackupUsage()` reads the
folder so the figure appears alongside the database breakdown instead of
being invisible. Collecting the JSON is not the cost: 762 docs with 5.7 MB
of attachments took 55 ms end to end.

### Shared utilities (`utils.ts`)

| Export | Used by |
|---|---|
| `dueLabel` | Kanban, List |
| `dueLabelLong` | Dashboard, Agenda |
| `dueRelative` | Agenda |
| `dueInk` | ListView |
| `filterTasks` | ListView, KanbanBoard, `phone/project/filter.ts` |
| `fmtDay` | the one date style: "Wed 30 Sep" / "30 Sep", year only when not this year (desktop views, History; the phone's `shortDate()` in `phone/format.ts` matches it) |
| `localDateStr` and friends | everywhere a calendar day matters |

All date-only logic goes through `localDateStr()`. Never use
`toISOString().slice(0, 10)` for a calendar day — it shifts to UTC.

**Day rollover (`today.ts`).** Views stay mounted across midnight (the
desktop is tray-resident), so anything that labels or groups by "today"
reads the `today` store, never a date captured at mount. It is a lazy
`readable` holding `localDateStr(now)`: one `setTimeout` to the next local
midnight (built from calendar fields, so DST days are 23/25 h), re-armed
on every fire, plus an immediate re-check on `visibilitychange`, `focus`
and Capacitor's document `resume`, since timers stall while a device
sleeps. The timer and listeners exist only while something is subscribed.
Templates pass `$today` into the due helpers (`dueLabel`, `dueInk`,
`dueLabelLong`, `dueRelative`, phone `duePill`, `dateFromToday`), whose
optional `today` argument makes the expression re-run at midnight; screens
whose groups come from a query (Dashboard, Focus, phone Home/Today/Agenda/
Focus) reload through `onNewDay()`, which skips the current day.

## Testing & Dev Workflows

Full test conventions live in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md). In short: `db.ts`
logic runs against `pouchdb-adapter-memory`, components run under
`@testing-library/svelte` with `db`/`store` mocked, and three suites test
the real thing — `replication.test.ts` (PouchDB's actual replicator between
two databases), `backupRestore.test.ts` (export → wipe → restore), and
`perfGuard.test.ts` (counts database round-trips, never wall-clock time).

`tests/setup.ts` shims what jsdom lacks: the `PouchDB` global, an in-memory
`localStorage` (Node's own global shadows jsdom's), `Element.animate`,
`matchMedia`, and `scrollIntoView`.

`npm run bench` (`tests/perf.bench.ts`, `tests/scale.bench.ts`) is a separate
Vitest benchmark over the hot read paths. It is not a CI gate — `perfGuard.test.ts` is, since
round-trip counts are stable across machines and wall-clock times are not.

### CI (`.github/workflows/`)

- **`ci.yml`** — on `offlog-app/**`: version consistency, type-check,
  zero-warning build, tests.
- **`desktop-ci.yml`** — on `src-tauri/**` and the NyxDB fetch script: a
  real release `cargo build`, which also warms the cache release runs
  restore. Deliberately not all of `offlog-desktop/**` — dev-only scripts
  and `mdns-browse/` must not spend a release build.
- **`codeql.yml`** — JS/TS, Rust and Actions, all build-mode `none`.
- **`codeql-android.yml`** — Java/Kotlin, the only analysis needing a real
  build. Scoped to `android/**`, `capacitor.config.ts` and
  `package-lock.json`, since nothing else can change its result. Compiles
  with `compileDebugJavaWithJavac` rather than `assembleDebug` — CodeQL
  needs javac traces, not dexing or packaging — and caches Gradle
  dependencies, which `release.yml`'s tag build also restores.
  `gradle.properties` enables `org.gradle.parallel` and
  `org.gradle.caching` for release builds; this job compiles with
  `--no-build-cache`, because a cached compile never runs javac and CodeQL
  then sees no source. The JDK must be
  installed *before* CodeQL init or the extractor sees no source.
  `node_modules` is excluded via `codeql-config.yml`.
- **`release.yml`** — on a `vX.Y.Z` tag: builds the Android APK (signed with
  the real key when the signing secrets are set, else the debug key) and the
  Windows installer, attaches both to a draft Release.

Every workflow except `release.yml` cancels superseded in-flight runs for
the same ref.

### Windows distribution

The Windows installer is **not code-signed**. Paid certificates were ruled
out as incompatible with how this project is distributed; a free path may be
adopted later if one exists that doesn't require payment. Until then Windows
shows an "unknown publisher" prompt on first install. Android's equivalent
warning is handled by the Play Store listing instead.

The desktop **updater** has its own signing key (generated once, stored only
as a GitHub Actions secret) — unrelated to code signing, and already in use.

It reads `releases/latest/download/latest.json`, which resolves through two
redirects: GitHub first works out *which* release is latest, then serves that
tag's asset. Two consequences, both normal:

- A **draft** release is invisible to it. `release.yml` creates drafts on
  purpose, so the updater only offers a version once it is published.
- For a few minutes after publishing, that first redirect can still resolve
  to the previous tag, and the app correctly reports itself up to date. It is
  propagation lag, not caching — the redirects carry `Cache-Control:
  no-cache` and `checkForUpdate()` has no throttle of its own.

### Generating test data

- **`scripts/seed-scenario.js`** — paste into the DevTools console. Covers
  every feature with randomized content, including deliberately messy cases
  (duplicate titles, near-duplicate notes). Calls `db.ts`'s own functions,
  so it can't drift from its invariants.
- **`scripts/seed-demo.js`** — a hand-authored, deterministic dataset (one
  persona, 4 spaces, 13 projects) for reproducible screenshots. Use its
  `WIPE_EXISTING: true`.
- **`npm run build:demo`** — a test build (`.env.demo`, `VITE_DEMO_DATA=1`)
  whose fresh install fills itself with the same demo workspace
  (`src/lib/demoSeed.ts`, once per install). Debug APKs for phone testing are
  built from it. A normal `npm run build` compiles the branch out — no demo
  code ships.
- **`scripts/seed-full.js`** — the big one: every writable feature at
  volume, to **exact** counts (10 spaces, 30 projects, 500 tasks, and a
  fixed number of checklists, custom values, reminders, links and so on).
  The `TARGET` block at the top is the contract; the summary reports what
  actually landed and warns on any mismatch, so a shortfall is visible
  rather than assumed. `WIPE_EXISTING` defaults to **true** — the counts
  are only meaningful on an empty database.
  Covers what the other two don't: recurrence intervals and weekdays-only,
  blocked-by in both resolved and unresolved states, attachments on both
  the image and non-image branches, projects from a template with and
  without tasks, every column shape with every column populated, column
  add/rename/remove/reorder, tag rename, and all four custom field types.
  It also re-dates the changelog: every write stamps a log at "now", so a
  post-pass thins them and spreads them back over 120 days.
  **Run it from the DevTools console, not by serving it from `public/`** —
  writing into `public/` (or running `npm run build`/`vitest`) while the
  dev server is up triggers a full page reload that kills the run partway.
  Expect a few minutes at 500 tasks: creation slows as the database grows,
  since every write invalidates the task cache and the mounted UI
  re-renders on each change.

- **Anything smaller** — write straight to `new PouchDB('offlog')` in the
  console. Assign `column.id`, never the column object, or the task renders
  nowhere. Reload afterwards so the task cache picks it up.

### Resetting to a fresh state

Do this after any real test round; dev state accumulates silently.

- **Desktop**: `offlog-desktop/scripts/reset-dev-env.ps1` — debug-build files only (see
  the debug/release table under Desktop). `-IncludeRelease` also wipes the
  *installed* app's host config, NyxDB data and `Offlog.log` — only when
  confirmed disposable. It never touches the release WebView2 profile.
- **Web**: `new PouchDB('offlog').destroy().then(() => localStorage.clear())`,
  then reload. Clearing PouchDB alone leaves `offlog_seeded` set and produces a
  zero-spaces state that no real install ever has.
- **Android**: `adb shell pm clear com.offlog.app.debug`, or reinstall.
- **Automatic backups** live outside PouchDB and survive a `destroy()`.

### Debugging sync discovery

`offlog-desktop/mdns-browse/` is a ~20-line script that browses for
`_offlog._tcp` and prints what it finds. `npm install && node browse.js`. It
answers the first question behind most sync failures: is the PC advertising,
and can the phone see it? That separates a discovery problem from a pairing
or replication one.

---

## How Sync Works

**The idea.** Every device keeps a complete copy of the database and works
offline. There is no server that owns the data — the optional sync server is
just another copy that all devices can reach. When two copies meet, they
exchange whatever the other is missing. Turn sync off and nothing breaks;
you simply stop exchanging.

**Why PouchDB.** It implements the CouchDB replication protocol, which
solves the hard part: each document carries a revision history, so two
copies can work out what changed without a central coordinator. The server
can be real CouchDB or NyxDB (the small Rust server the desktop app embeds)
— the app only needs something that speaks the protocol.

**What actually happens.**

1. `startSync()` opens a live bidirectional replication with the configured
   server.
2. A local write replicates out immediately.
3. A remote change fires a `.changes()` event; `store.ts` reloads.
4. Offline, writes queue locally; replication resumes on reconnect. On
   Android, Capacitor's `resume` also restarts it (`syncOnResume()`): a long
   background grows PouchDB's retry backoff to 5–10 minutes without the
   WebView ever seeing an `offline` event.

**Conflicts.** If two devices edit the same task while apart, both revisions
survive and PouchDB picks a deterministic winner. The loser stays as a live
branch until something resolves it — resolving means removing every losing
revision explicitly, including one whose content you adopted. Conflicts are
counted after each sync and shown as a badge; resolution is available in
Settings. The screen passes the revisions it displayed to `resolveConflict()`,
which refuses (`ConflictChangedError`) if sync changed them in the meantime.

**End-to-end encryption.** With a sync key (`offlog_sync_key`, 32 bytes,
base64, from the PC), the remote PouchDB gets `fetch: encryptedFetch(...)`
(`db/encryptedFetch.ts`) and the database is `encryptedDbName(key)`
(`offlog-e-` + 16 hex digits of a SHA-256 of the key, the same in
`sync_host.rs`); without one it is
the readable `offlog` (an older PC, or a server set up by hand). The fetch
rewrites `_bulk_docs`, `_revs_diff`, `_bulk_get`, `_changes`, `_all_docs`
and single-document and attachment reads, and seals `_local/` checkpoint
bodies (`sealLocal`; one that doesn't open reads as 404, so PouchDB
compares from the start). `_design/` docs are encrypted like any other.
Only the server root (its uuid feeds the replication id, so an address
change doesn't restart the comparison) and the database's own info and
create request pass through. Documents are sealed one at a time, so a batch
with photos never holds every copy at once. `syncCrypto.ts` derives five
keys by HKDF:

- **ids**: `x:` + base64url(iv ‖ AES-GCM(id)), iv = HMAC(id)[0..12].
  Deterministic, so revisions still match and any device can reverse a
  server id without the document; only the exact spelling opens, since a
  loosely decoded twin would alias a real document and stall its pull.
- **documents**: `{_id, _rev, _deleted?, _revisions?, _attachments?, e}`,
  `e` sealing `{i: id, d: body, a: {name: {content_type, digest}}, r: _revisions}`;
  the AAD binds server id, rev and deleted flag; the sealed history must
  end in that rev and replaces the server's; the server's attachment
  names must be exactly the sealed ones.
- **attachments**: 2-byte type length, content type, bytes, sealed under
  their own key with AAD = server id + name and an IV that is an HMAC of
  all of that (unchanged content seals to the same bytes, and NyxDB stores
  one file per distinct content, so an edit doesn't store a new copy),
  stored as
  `application/octet-stream`; a fetched attachment comes back with its
  real type.

What doesn't open is dropped before the replicator sees it and counted,
once per server revision, in `syncState.rejected` (shown in Settings →
Sync; reset with each new remote). It fails closed: a request outside its
database, an endpoint it doesn't handle, a filtered `_changes` or keyed
`_all_docs`, or any write other than `_bulk_docs` with `new_edits: false`
and checkpoint PUTs is refused instead of sent. `remote()` refuses an
`offlog-e-` address without a key. On the desktop,
`initTauriSyncDefaults()` takes the key from `get_sync_info`; moving off a
`/offlog` URL sets `offlog_plain_server_to_retire`, and
`retirePlainServer()` (after a settled sync, from `markSynced`) pulls that
database in, unchecked, destroys it and clears the flag. Only then: an
older app can't recreate it, because pairing requires protocol `v: 2`
(`pairing.rs` `PAIRING_VERSION`, 426 otherwise). A phone gets the key in
the pairing reply; `clearPairedHost()` (Own server, a hand-typed desktop
URL) drops it, so a server set up by hand syncs readable. `tests/encryptedSync.e2e.test.ts` runs two devices through a
real NyxDB and reads the server raw (Desktop CI; skips without the binary).

**Phantom conflicts.** NyxDB before v0.1.7 never sent a doc's revision
history, so each pulled edit was stored as a new root beside the copy a
device had: a "conflict" per edit whose losers are only older steps of the
same doc. Once per device, before the first conflict count after a sync
settles, `removePhantomConflicts()` asks the server for the history of the
version the device shows and removes a losing leaf only if that history
lists it. Anything else is a genuine conflict and stays. It is marked done
(`offlog_phantom_cleanup_v1`) only after every conflicting doc was checked;
an unreachable server, a pre-0.1.7 server or a winner not pushed yet leaves
it to retry on the next settle.

**Sync state** (`syncState`) tracks more than idle/error:

- `lastSynced` persists to `localStorage`, or the sidebar reads "Not synced
  yet" after every restart.
- Offline is its own status, not an error — a failure while
  `navigator.onLine` is false would otherwise look like a server problem.
  Coming back online triggers a sync.
- `describeSyncError()` turns raw 401/403/404/network errors into short,
  actionable text.
- `retryCount` surfaces how many consecutive attempts have failed.
- `rejected` counts server items that didn't open under the sync key.

## Theme System

All colours are CSS custom properties in `app.css` — `:root` for light,
`body.dark` for dark. Outside `app.css`, colours are hand-kept copies only
where CSS can't reach: Android `values/colors.xml` / `values-night/colors.xml`,
`theme-color` in `index.html`, `public/theme-init.js` and `theme.ts`; each
mirrors a token and must move with it. `constants.ts`'s `PRIORITY_COLOR`
is fixed hex for medium and high, drawn at full strength on both shells;
low has no hue of its own (`--border-strong`), so green keeps meaning done. Derived tints use
`color-mix(in srgb, var(--accent) X%, transparent)`.

| Token | Light | Dark | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--bg` | `#F6F7F9` | `#181A20` | page background |
| `--surface` | `#FFFFFF` | `#242934` | cards, panels |
| `--sidebar-bg` | `#FBFBFC` | `#101218` | sidebar (follows theme) |
| `--top-tint` | `--accent` 6% over `--bg` | same | the flat band a glowing phone header (Home's hero, a TopBar panel) starts with, so the status-bar strip can take the same colour |
| `--statusbar-fill` | `#f6f7f9` | `#181a20` | Android status-bar strip. `--bg` at rest; `body.statusbar-glow` makes it `--top-tint` under a glowing header (every TopBar claims: a panel the glow, any other the plain strip); `body.statusbar-hero` makes it `--hero` (the loading screen). Claims go through `theme.ts` (`setStatusBarOnHero`, `claimStatusBar`; latest live claim wins), applied after the native icon style lands |
| `--col-bg` | `#ECEEF2` | `#1E222C` | Board status column fill |
| `--border` | `#E2E4EA` | `#2F3542` | hairlines |
| `--border-strong` | `#C7CBD6` | `#3F4657` | stronger dividers, scrollbar |
| `--state-hover` | `8%` | `8%` | hover tint alpha; `16%` in both high-contrast blocks |
| `--state-press` | `12%` | `12%` | pressed tint alpha; `22%` in high contrast |
| `--hover` | derived | derived | `color-mix(--text, --state-hover, transparent)` — a tint of the element's own ink, so it is visible on any ground, including `--col-bg` |

| `--sel-fill` / `--sel-ring` | `--text` 8% / 1px `--accent` 22% + 8px `--glow` | same | the selected pill and its glow, for components whose own scoped rules outrank `.is-selected` |
| `--rail-bg` / `--rail-hover` | `--text` 6% / 7% | same | desktop header controls: a 34px rail (Board/List, List/Month, Search + Filters, List toolbar) or a lone 34px square, 26px buttons inside, the selected one a `--surface` pill with the glow; the phone's `.p-seg` is the same shape on `--col-bg` |
| `--field-bg` | `--text` 5% | same | desktop fields and secondary buttons: a soft fill with a transparent 1px border (focus colours it), never an outline; home-screen cards and rows are `.glass`, other cards still `--surface` + `--elev-1`, dialogs keep only a `--glass-edge` hairline |
| `--line` | `--text` 7% | same | the one divider tone. Lines only for dense tables (List), menu groups, the Board card footer, and pinned bars over scrolling content (sheet titles once scrolled); related rows get an inset line that starts at the text; never under a heading. History, Recycle bin, Settings, phone Home, sheets and the command palette have none |
| `--r-s` / `--r-m` / `--r-l` / `--r-xl` | 8 / 10 / 14 / 20px | same | radius scale: inner controls, fields and buttons, cards and columns, dialogs and glass panels (`--radius` = `--r-l`, `--radius-sm` = `--r-m`) |
| `--fs-2xs` … `--fs-t` | 10 / 11 / 12.5 / 13.5 / 15 / 17 / 20px | same | desktop type scale for new and restyled desktop text, and for shared components both shells render (the phone's own screens keep `--p-fs-*`) |
| `--elev-1` / `--elev-2` / `--elev-3` | 1–3px soft / 12px soft / 32px 14% (+ `-up`, `-side` for sheets and side panels) | 1px `--text` 7% edge + darker shadows | the only shadows: resting content; floating chrome (glass, toasts, hover lift); overlays (menus = `.glass.pop`, sheets, dialogs, panels, +). Phone `--p-shadow` is `--elev-1`. Only switch knobs, scroll fades, the drag ghost and scrims keep their own |

**Fluid glass** (`.glass` and `.is-selected` in app.css) covers floating chrome (bars, menus, dropdowns, the date picker, sheets, toasts, the main views' headers) and, on desktop, the sidebar, the home screen's focus strip, cards and rows, the Board's columns and cards, and the Agenda's groups, month grid and day panel (lined rows inside; the month fills the view until a day is open). The red error toast stays solid. Every main view — desktop Board, Dashboard, Agenda, Focus; phone Home, Today, Agenda, Search, Focus and a project — opens with its header as a `.fluid-panel` of glass. On desktop the whole window sits on one even light, `--ambient` on `.layout` (almost no colour), and the sidebar is a floating glass panel over it whose top lines up with the headers (both 14px): `.fluid-stage` in app.css on desktop, `TopBar panel` (sticky to its screen's scroller, so the list passes under the glass) and Home's hero on the phone. No screen has a solid colour band. Phone sheets sit over a dimming scrim, so they set `--glass-fill` to solid `--surface` locally and carry `.glass.solid`, which drops the blur they could not show; their sticky handle and title take the sheet's own fill. Primary buttons on both shells are neutral (`--text` fill, `--bg` ink); a destructive one is `--danger`. No filled action button is accent except the + buttons and Undo in a toast; the accent otherwise marks state and wayfinding (links, focus rings, switches that are on, checked boxes, the calendar's selected day, counts and progress) and the brand mark. The phone tab bar floats over the screens (`--tab-h`, measured, is the room each scroller adds at its end); Board and List panes stop above it instead, and the landscape rail stays in the layout. Glass inside glass has nothing to blur: it goes solid, except `.glass-inner` (Board cards in a glass column), a lighter see-through fill with no blur of its own; a small button on glass is a `.glass-chip` (faint fill, glass edge and highlight; the sidebar footer). No dashed lines anywhere: borders are solid. Never forms, and never glass over a dimming scrim (it turns muddy grey there: the palette, quick add, dialogs and phone sheets stay solid). It is solid by default and turns see-through only where `backdrop-filter` works and neither `prefers-reduced-transparency` nor Settings → Reduce transparency (`body.reduce-transparency`; Android feeds the media query nothing) asks otherwise. A parent with `opacity`, `filter` or `clip-path` confines the blur. A blurred element is also the containing block of its `position: fixed` descendants and walls off what a menu inside it can blur, so glass that nothing moves behind (desktop view headers, Board columns, Agenda panels) carries `.flat`: same fill, no blur. Menus and drop-downs (`.glass.pop`) are frosted (`--pop-*`) even inside other glass, so what is under them shows through blurred; a drop-down inside a menu goes solid. Glass is separated by its edge and top highlight, with only a hint of shadow (`--glass-shadow`, 1–2px); hover brightens the edge (`--glass-edge-hover`) and never grows the shadow. Selected means a neutral pill plus weight, with the faint accent glow on `::after`; hover never glows. That covers navigation (sidebar, tab bar), segmented controls (Board/List, List/Month, Settings choices, status pills) and choice chips; on a filled `--col-bg` track the pill is `--surface` with the ring, since the faint fill barely shows there. Calendars on both shells mark today with an accent ring and the selected day with a solid accent dot. Glass goes solid inside glass, under Reduce transparency, and under High contrast (Settings or the OS), where it also gets a 2px edge.

The saturated colours are deliberately muted (OKLCH chroma ×0.8, same hue and
lightness, every text pair still AA). User-picked space and tag colours are
stored as picked and muted at render time by `soften()` in `tagColors.ts`, so
seed detection and tag-colour balancing still see the original hex. `soften()` uses CSS relative colour syntax (`oklch(from …)`, Chromium 119+); an older WebView drops the declaration and the dot or tint goes blank.

`body.high-contrast` / `body.dark.high-contrast` also raise `--border`,
`--border-strong`, `--text`, `--muted` and `--faint` (never the meaning
colours). Phone-only type and shadow tokens (`--p-fs-*`, `--p-shadow`) live in
`phone/phone.css`, scoped to `.phone-shell`/`.psheet`.

Changing `--accent` or `--hero-base` also means updating `capacitor.config.ts`'s
`iconColor` and `android.backgroundColor` (= `--hero-base`), Android's `values/colors.xml` (`colorPrimary`, `colorAccent`,
`splashBg` = `--hero-base`, and the `colorWidget*` set) and
`values-night/colors.xml` (`splashBg` and the `colorWidget*` set only), and
`resources/generate-icons.cjs`'s `BRAND` (currently `#575fca`). The widget
colours mirror `--text`/`--accent`, with `colorWidgetBg` on `--bg`
in light and `--surface` in dark; `colorWidgetSurface` is a widget-only
shade. `generate-icons.cjs` and `generate-splash.cjs` need `sharp`, which is not
a dependency: run `npm i --no-save sharp` in `offlog-app/` first.
`generate-installer-art.cjs` needs nothing extra: it draws with headless Edge,
since the banner uses the brand font.
`<meta theme-color>` is not an accent: it follows the theme background
(`#f6f7f9` / `#181a20`), set pre-paint by `public/theme-init.js` and kept in
step by `theme.ts`.

Dark mode is applied before first paint by `public/theme-init.js`, so there
is no flash of light.

**Note:** `SettingsPanel`'s panel is a DOM *sibling* of the sidebar, not a
descendant. Both read page-level tokens; neither inherits from the other.

---

## View Persistence

The last desktop view is saved to `offlog_view` in `sessionStorage` as
`{ view, projectId, mode }` and restored on reload within the session.
Active space and project ids are saved separately in `localStorage` so the
sidebar highlights correctly. The phone shell always opens on Home.

---

## Notifications

`notifications.ts` handles both platforms. It imports `db.ts`; `db.ts` never
imports it, so there is no cycle.

**Reminder field.** `reminder_at` is an absolute ISO timestamp, independent
of `due_date`, converted to and from local time explicitly.

**Scheduling model: cancel all, reschedule from scratch.** `rescheduleAll()`
runs from `store.ts`'s `reload()`, which already fires after every local
mutation and every incoming sync change. It fetches all active tasks with a
future reminder, cancels everything scheduled, and re-schedules. Completing,
deleting or archiving a task simply drops it from the query, so its
notification disappears with no special-casing. At personal scale this is
cheaper than tracking every call site.

**Android** hands scheduling to the OS (`AlarmManager`), so reminders fire
with the app fully closed. Task ids are hashed to a 32-bit integer because
the plugin requires numeric ids. Tapping a notification opens that task;
its **Done** and **Snooze 1h** actions act on the task directly.
Quiet hours (`applyQuietHours()`) push a reminder that would land inside
them to their end, staggered, on both platforms.
Needs `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`, `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` and
`RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`. Exact alarms are requested only while
`exactAlarmState` is `granted`: the plugin's `schedule()` opens the system
"Alarms & reminders" page by itself for any exact request without the grant,
which would happen on every launch. Without it reminders are scheduled
inexact, and the first reminder newly set in a launch bumps
`exactAlarmNudge`; the phone shell turns that into a "Reminders may be a few
minutes late · Turn on" snackbar. Settings › Notifications shows the same
fix as a warning row. The plugin's `schedule()` likewise asks for
`POST_NOTIFICATIONS` by itself, so `scheduleNative()` schedules nothing
until that is granted: Android asks at the first reminder the user sets
(task reminder sheet or quick add), never at launch, and
`requestPermission()`/`recheckGrants()` reschedule once it is. A fresh
install's "not asked yet" reads as `default`, not `denied`. On every return to the foreground `recheckGrants()`
re-reads both grants and reschedules everything if the exact-alarm grant
changed.

**Windows** has no notification plugin. Reminders are JS `setTimeout` timers
in the tray-resident app, plus the same 24-hour catch-up as the web, and the
hourly housekeeping pass re-arms them, so they fire only while Offlog runs;
after Quit they wait for the next start. At fire time `fireTauriNotification`
reads Windows' per-app switch (`check_desktop_notification_setting`): while it
is off the reminder keeps its `reminder_at` and the permission reads denied.
The toast comes from the Rust command `send_task_notification`
(tauri-winrt-notification), with the Reminder scenario so it stays on screen
until acted on; a toast that could not be sent is retried by the next re-arm.
Done, Snooze 1h and a plain click come back as the `notification-action`
event; a click restores and focuses the window. The press only reaches a
running app: no COM activator is registered, so a toast acted on after Quit
does nothing. Toasts are attributed to the AUMID `com.offlog.app`, which the
installer's Start-menu shortcut registers.

**Web** is best-effort: there is no push backend by design, so notifications
use `setTimeout` while the tab is open, plus a catch-up on load that fires
anything that came due in the last 24 hours (`CATCH_UP_WINDOW_MS`); an
older missed reminder is cleared from its task.

**Firing never writes to the task.** Desktop and web remember what they
already showed in a per-device list (`offlog_fired_reminders` in
localStorage, keyed `id:reminder_at`, last 500). Clearing `reminder_at` on
fire synced to the phone and cancelled its alarm before it rang, and two
devices clearing offline came back as a conflict. A fired reminder stays on
its task until it is 24 hours old, when the catch-up pass clears it. Permission is requested lazily,
never on load.

## Mobile (Android)

Capacitor wraps the same `dist/` in a WebView — same PouchDB, same sync,
same UI.

- **System font size**: `fontScale` is in MainActivity's `configChanges`, so
  changing it doesn't recreate the activity (that reloaded the page and lost
  the open screen); `onConfigurationChanged` rescales the WebView's text zoom.
- **Touch drag on the desktop Board** (tablet-sized screens get the desktop
  views): HTML5 drag events don't fire on touch, so `KanbanBoard.svelte`
  uses `touchstart`/`touchmove`/`touchend` with `document.elementFromPoint`.
- **Status bar**: targetSdk 36 forces edge-to-edge, and
  `StatusBar.setBackgroundColor()` is a hard no-op from API 35. The app
  embraces it instead: content draws behind a transparent bar, and a
  `.status-bar-fill` strip of `env(safe-area-inset-top)` sits behind it.
  Needs `viewport-fit=cover`.
  While the phone Home's hero is under the bar, Home holds a
  `claimStatusBar({ lightIcons: true })` (theme.ts): light icons, and
  `body.statusbar-hero` (strip = `--hero`) once the native call resolves, so
  the strip never changes ahead of the icons; scrolling the hero away or
  leaving Home clears it. `setStatusBarOnHero()` is only for the phone
  loading screen, which is `--hero` too, continuing the launch splash
  (`splashBg` in android colors.xml). `setStatusBarSuppressed(locked)` drops
  every tint while App Lock covers the app, and `stripVisible()` skips the
  tint when the strip is 0px tall (WebViews that report no top inset), where
  light icons would vanish on the system's light bar. The strip sits below every modal
  scrim (z-index 299), so dialogs and sheets dim it with the page.
  Home and the project screen claim the plain strip through
  `claimStatusBar(null)`. Claims stack: the newest live one wins and releasing it
  hands the strip back, so a screen whose outro ends after the next screen
  claimed cannot undo that claim.
- **Phone shell and the keyboard**: the WebView resizes (`adjustResize`), so
  PhoneApp hides the navigation bar and + button while a text field is
  focused, the page is not pinch-zoomed, and the visual viewport is more than
  150px shorter than its tallest height at this width (re-checked on
  focusin/focusout, so moving between fields keeps it right). On the phone,
  delete-undo goes through the shell's snackbar and `showError` toasts drop
  in at the top (`pointer-events: none`, so the top bar stays usable).
  In quick add a picker panel and the keyboard never share the screen:
  opening a panel blurs the title; a pick, Done, or a tap on the title
  refocuses it inside that tap (Android only raises the keyboard for a focus
  made during a user gesture) and closes the panel. The panel is sized to
  the last keyboard height measured (`phone/quickadd/memory.ts`: the drop
  below the tallest visual viewport at this width; 280px until one is
  seen), so the title row stays put when one swaps for the other.
- **Quick add parse feedback**: `parseQuickAdd()` also returns `spans`
  (offsets into the typed text). The title `<input>` has transparent text
  over an `aria-hidden` mirror that draws the same text with those spans
  tinted; the two share font, line-height and padding, and the mirror
  copies the input's `scrollLeft`. Tapping a tinted token offers "Keep
  “word” as text", which inserts a `\` before it — the parser's per-token escape — so
  the choice lives in the text and survives edits. Chips with a value sort
  first. The default project is the last one added to from Quick add
  (`offlog_quickadd_last_project` in localStorage), after an `@mention` or
  the opening project's context.
- **Notification icons** must be white silhouettes with transparency, or
  Android substitutes a generic triangle.
- **Home-screen widget** (`OffologWidgetProvider.java`,
  `res/xml/offlog_widget_info.xml`): one widget, "Quick actions", with Focus,
  Quick Add and Home shortcuts. Its colours (`colorWidget*` in
  `values[-night]/colors.xml`) are app.css tokens and follow the system
  light/dark setting; the corner radius is the launcher's own on Android 12+.
  `updatePeriodMillis="0"` means `onUpdate()` only
  runs when an instance is placed — a widget already on the home screen
  keeps stale PendingIntents until it is removed and re-added, or the
  device reboots.
- `enterkeyhint` on inputs; breakpoints at 900/768/600/440px; `source` is
  the device name.

```bash
npm run build && npx cap sync android

## Desktop (Tauri)

`offlog-desktop/` sits beside `offlog-app/` in this repo. Its
`frontendDist` points at `offlog-app/dist`, so it wraps the exact same build
the browser and Android use. The only new code is Rust.

**Embedded sync host** (`sync_host.rs`). On first launch it generates a
random port, admin password and 32-byte sync key, saves them to
`app_data_dir()/sync-host.json`, and spawns
[NyxDB](https://github.com/hrach-gevorgyan/nyxdb) as a child process
configured entirely by environment variables — no config file. A Windows Job
Object (`JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`) ties that process to the app's
lifetime on every exit path, including a crash. The binary is built by
`scripts/fetch-nyxdb-win.ps1` from a pinned tag, checked against its commit id and built `--locked`, and is not committed.

`sync-host.json` is the host's identity; regenerating it breaks every
paired phone. It is written via temp file + rename. A file that won't
parse is renamed to `sync-host.json.bad-<unix-secs>` (with a log warning)
before a new identity is generated; one that can't be read at all gets a
session-only identity and is left on disk. A file from before the sync key
gains one once, together with a new password, so phones that never got the
key stop syncing instead of writing readable documents. `ensure_database`
creates the database named after the key (`encrypted_db_name`), so a new
key starts an empty one and the app re-uploads into it; nothing is wiped
under a running replication. A database left from an old key holds only
ciphertext and stays (NyxDB has no `_all_dbs` to find it). Database
creation, the pairing
server and mDNS run once NyxDB accepts connections: after the first 20 s
the background thread keeps re-checking with a 1 s → 30 s capped backoff
for as long as the sidecar process is alive, so a slow start delays
pairing instead of disabling it for the session.

**NyxDB data folder** (v0.1.8): sled files plus `att/<db>/<sha256>`, one file
per distinct attachment content. NyxDB sweeps unreferenced files itself (a
minute after start, about daily when idle, and on `_compact`, never one
under an hour old) and `DELETE /{db}` removes that database's folder, so
Offlog never deletes inside it while NyxDB runs; only the debug-only
`reset_sync_data` removes the whole folder, after terminating NyxDB. The
first start after upgrading moves attachments out of sled in the
background while serving; readiness (`GET /`) doesn't wait for it, and
nothing kills NyxDB during it. Measured from a v0.1.5 folder (24,856 docs,
200 attachments, 275 MB): `GET /` after 3.6 s, migration done after 5.9 s;
each client's one full re-compare then took ~8.5 s, the next one 5 ms.
sled's old files don't shrink.

**Supervision.** The same background thread then polls the sidecar every
5 s (`supervise_nyxdb()` in `lib.rs`). If NyxDB exits on its own it is
restarted with the same binary, data dir, port and credentials, inside the
original Job Object (`sync_host::respawn_nyxdb()`), then readiness and
`ensure_database` run again. Backoff and the rest rule are the pure
`sync_host::RestartPolicy`: 2 s doubling to a 60 s cap, and the 5th exit
within 5 minutes pauses restarts for an hour (logged as an error), then the
policy starts over: a tray session lasts weeks, and a burst's usual causes (a
full disk, a file a scanner holds) clear on their own. A
failed respawn counts as another exit. The pairing server and mDNS start
once per session, the first time NyxDB is ready, never again on restart.
NyxDB exits with code 3 when it can't open its store; on the second such
exit in a row (one can be a passing lock), once per session, the data dir is
renamed to `<name>.damaged-<unix-secs>`, never deleted, and NyxDB restarts on
a fresh one (`sync_host::DamagedStore`, `set_aside_data_dir`). Every device
holds a full copy and re-uploads on its next sync; the encrypted database is
recreated by `ensure_database` as usual. The move includes NyxDB's `att/` attachment
files (one rename of the whole folder). Settings → Sync then says so and
where the old folder is (`get_sync_data_set_aside`, the
`sync-data-set-aside` event, `syncDataSetAside` in `config.ts`). Moved-aside
folders are never deleted by the app; remove them by hand once nothing is
needed from them.
Deliberate teardown — `terminate_nyxdb()` (tray Quit, `ExitRequested`) and
debug `reset_sync_data` — sets `NYXDB_STOPPING` before killing, and the
supervisor re-checks it under the `NyxdbProcess` lock before respawning,
so a quit is never mistaken for a crash.

**Debug vs release on one machine.** Both share the identifier, so
`app_data_dir()` and `app_local_data_dir()` are the same folders. Every
per-build file is split on `debug_assertions`; release names are the
originals and must never change:

| | release | debug |
|---|---|---|
| host identity | `sync-host.json` | `sync-host.dev.json` |
| NyxDB data | `nyxdb-data/` | `nyxdb-data-dev/` |
| stored sync credential (DPAPI) | `sync-secret.enc` | `sync-secret.dev.enc` |
| WebView2 profile (IndexedDB, localStorage) | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.offlog.app\EBWebView` | `…\com.offlog.app\webview-dev\` |
| log | `…\com.offlog.app\logs\Offlog.log` | `…\logs\Offlog-dev.log` |
| single-instance lock | yes | none: the lock is keyed on the identifier alone, so a dev run would only surface the installed app |
| login entry (tray "Start on login") | toggles and refreshes it | item disabled, never rewritten |

The WebView2 split matters because both builds load the same
`tauri.localhost` origin: without it a dev run reads and writes the
installed app's PouchDB tasks and `offlog_sync_url`. Debug builds set
`create: false` on the config window in `run()` and build it in `setup()`
with `.data_directory(...)`; release builds keep Tauri's own window
creation. A debug build from before this split used the shared profile,
so dev data written then lives in the release profile.

**Discovery and pairing** (`discovery.rs`, `pairing.rs`, `discovery.ts`).
The PC advertises `_offlog._tcp` over mDNS carrying a uuid and pairing port
— deliberately no credentials over the air. Pairing is a separate
single-endpoint HTTP server: the PC shows a 6-digit code, single-use, valid
5 minutes; the phone posts a PBKDF2-derived proof of it (never the code
itself) and gets the real credentials and the sync key back
AES-256-GCM-encrypted under a key derived the same way — see [security.md §1](security.md#1-connecting-a-phone-to-your-pc-pairing)
for the full protocol and its honest limits. There are no fixed username/password
constants, because nothing could match a per-install random password.
The pairing server logs only outcomes — "succeeded" and a running count of
rejected requests — never the code, proof, nonce or response. Each request
runs on its own thread, at most 8 at once (more get 503); a request that
hasn't finished within 10 s gives its place back, so clients that drop
mid-request can't lock pairing until a restart.
The phone keeps the computer's uuid (to find it again after an address
change) and its announced name (`offlog_paired_host_name`, display only:
the Sync page's phone ↔ computer card). Phones paired before the name was
kept show "Your computer" until they pair again. Saving a server under
Own server clears both (`clearPairedHost()`): with the uuid left behind,
the stale-host re-resolve would point sync back at the computer whenever
the typed server was unreachable.

**Sync URL resolution is three-way**, which is easy to get wrong:

| Platform | Default | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Android | `''` | No way to guess an address |
| Desktop web | `127.0.0.1:5984` | Assumes a manually installed server on CouchDB's port |
| Tauri | resolved at boot | Its sidecar binds a *random* port, never 5984 |

`initTauriSyncDefaults()` runs before `startSync()` and asks the Rust side
for the real address. Skipping it points the desktop app at whatever else is
listening on 5984.

**Tray-resident** (`lib.rs`). Closing the window hides it; the only quit
path is the tray menu, which reuses the same NyxDB cleanup as a graceful
exit. Tray menu: Show Offlog / Quick Add / Settings / "Start on login" (reads the
real registry state) / Quit. A global `Ctrl+Alt+O` lands on Dashboard —
Quick Add already has Ctrl+N, so this one's job is just getting back in
fast. `bring_to_front()` toggles `always_on_top` true→false because a bare
`set_focus()` is ignored by Windows' foreground-lock timeout when called
from a background thread.

**Start on login.** The HKCU `Run` entry is `Offlog.exe --minimized`. With
that flag the app stays in the tray: `show_main_window_at_start` (App.svelte's
first-paint reveal) and the 5-second reveal fallback do nothing, while
`show_main_window` (a reminder click) and `bring_to_front()` (tray, shortcut,
a second launch) show it as usual. Each release start rewrites an enabled
entry, so an old one gains the flag and a moved install its new path; it
skips that when Windows Settings' Startup apps switch has it off, since
`enable()` would switch it back on, and debug builds never rewrite it. The
uninstaller removes the entry; updates keep it. An update restarts Offlog with
the old process's arguments, so `installUpdate()` sets a marker
(`markUpdateRelaunch`) that makes the next start reveal the window even
after a login start. The tray item's checkmark is re-read from the registry
when the menu opens and after every click, since Windows Settings can change
it while Offlog runs.

**Window placement** (tauri-plugin-window-state) restores size, position and
maximized state, never visibility. The plugin writes its file only on a
normal exit, which Offlog rarely has, so lib.rs also saves on close-to-tray,
on Quit and (`save_window_state`) before an update installs. A tray
left-click restores a minimized window rather than hiding it.

**Global shortcut.** `Ctrl+Alt+O` is registered in `setup()` unless the file
`global-shortcut-off` exists in the app config folder; Settings › Advanced ›
Windows switches it (`set_global_shortcut_enabled`). The off switch exists
because AltGr arrives as Ctrl+Alt, so on layouts with a letter on AltGr+O
(Polish "ó") the shortcut swallows it.

**Firewall.** NyxDB listens on `0.0.0.0` and the pairing server and mDNS run
inside Offlog.exe, so a first start shows Windows Defender Firewall prompts for
`nyxdb.exe` and `Offlog.exe`. The per-user install can't add allow rules, and
after Cancel Windows doesn't ask again: phone sync and pairing then fail. The
pairing error and the phone's "Can't reach" card name the firewall; the fix is
Windows Security › Firewall & network protection › Allow an app through
firewall, for both.

**Sync host port.** The port is drawn once from Windows' dynamic range and
saved. Each start `ensure_port_usable()` checks it still binds; when another
program holds it (and nothing NyxDB-like answers there), it moves to a fresh
port and saves it, keeping the password. Readiness is NyxDB's welcome document
(`fetch_uuid`), never a bare TCP accept, so a foreign listener is never sent
the password. `initTauriSyncDefaults()` re-reads the URL and credentials
every start while the app follows its own host, so it follows a port move or
a new identity.

**Content Security Policy** (`tauri.conf.json`). `script-src 'self'` (the
pre-paint theme script is same-origin); `style-src` allows `'unsafe-inline'`
for per-space colour attributes; `img-src 'self' blob:` (image attachments
are shown from blob URLs); `connect-src 'self' http://*:* https://*:*` — the
`:*` is **required**, since a bare `http://*` means port 80 only and every
real sync target uses a random port. Everything else is locked down:
`object-src 'none'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `base-uri 'self'`,
`form-action 'self'`.

**Installer** (NSIS). `sidebarImage` is a 24-bit BMP generated by
`offlog-app/resources/generate-installer-art.cjs` — NSIS requires classic
uncompressed 24-bit BMP specifically. It is the accent with the mark and
name at the top, the website's line "Your tasks. Your devices. Nobody
else's." at the bottom and a large faint mark off the corner, drawn at 1.5x
(246x471) because MUI's stretch is nearest-pixel and 150% is the commonest
scaling. There is deliberately **no
`headerImage`**: NSIS fills the rest of that bar with plain white and MUI2
offers no supported way to recolour it, so a dark header clashes instead of
reading as a banner.

The wording is Offlog's, without forking Tauri's `installer.nsi`:
`installer-hooks.nsh` (Tauri includes it above every page macro) defines the
MUI page texts, and `installer-english.nsh` replaces Tauri's own English
strings, including the uninstaller's delete-data checkbox, which removes the
tasks, backups and settings under `%APPDATA%` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.offlog.app`
and so must say so. That file must carry every key of the tauri-bundler
version in use; diff it against the new `English.nsh` after an upgrade. The
page headings and status lines are MUI language strings, which MUI sets only
when not already defined, so the hooks file defines them first. Only the
buttons and the disk-space labels stay stock, as standard Windows wording.

```bash
cd offlog-app && npm run build
cd ../offlog-desktop
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/fetch-nyxdb-win.ps1   # once
cargo tauri build
```

For local test installers, set `CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_INCREMENTAL=true`
first: a rebuild after a change to the app crate drops from about 3 minutes
to under 30 seconds (the first such build fills the cache). Release builds
in CI keep the default, non-incremental profile.

## Website (offlog.io)

`site/` is a static page, hand-written HTML and CSS with one script,
`site.js`: the hero (the Windows Dashboard window with the phone demo, built
in HTML rather than a screenshot, in front of it), the
auto-advancing Board/List/Agenda tabs, the playable "Today's three", the
scroll-linked phone, the screenshot tour (phone and Windows reels in
`site/img/tour/`), the filterable feature showroom (each feature is one
`<li data-cat>` in `index.html`; add new features there), and the privacy
receipt. The page is complete without
it, and every animation stops under prefers-reduced-motion. The nav's
pause button (`html.paused`) freezes the CSS animations and holds the
scripted loops; the hero demo also holds while it's under 40% on screen or
the tab is hidden. On phone widths the views tabs swap to phone
screenshots through `<picture>` sources. Light and dark
follow the visitor's system setting. It follows brand.md: one accent, Hanken Grotesk self-hosted
from `site/fonts/`, real app screenshots in `site/img/` as WebP. Every
screenshot ships twice, `name.webp` and a sharper `name-2x.webp`, picked by
`srcset`/`sizes`; make both from the full-size capture (2880 wide desktop,
1170 wide phone), never by upscaling. WebP quality is 0.8 for `name.webp`
and 0.72 for `-2x` (shown at a third of its size on a 3x phone, the
difference doesn't show); widths are what the layout needs at 2x/3x, no
more. Everything below the hero has `loading="lazy"` and fades in once it
arrives; the hero's Dashboard image is preloaded. It loads
nothing from other origins, and its CSP meta forbids inline styles and
scripts, so styling goes in `style.css`. `site/CNAME` holds `offlog.io`;
`.github/workflows/pages.yml` publishes `site/` to GitHub Pages on pushes
to `main` that touch it, and whenever a release is published
(`release-published.yml` starts it on `main`, since Pages refuses deploys
from a tag). Before upload,
`.github/scripts/stamp-release.mjs` writes the latest published release's
version, date, installer link and file sizes into the download section's
`data-rel` elements; the committed values are the fallback if that lookup
fails. The Android button links `releases/latest/download/app-release.apk`,
so the APK keeps that file name; `site/img/qr-apk.svg` (hidden at phone width)
encodes that same URL and was generated once with the `qrcode` npm package,
outside the repo. Preview locally with the `offlog-site` entry in
`.claude/launch.json` (Vite serving `site/` on port 4200). offlog.co is a
registrar-level redirect to offlog.io, not a second Pages site.
